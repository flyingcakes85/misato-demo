<p><em>Rust</em> is an amazing language. If you follow my blog activity and know me in person, you might know I’m really invested in rust on the last +12 months and also blogging a lot about Rust. Now I want to do something different. I do not want to paint a rosy picture of Rust. I do believe trade-offs matter, and you only know something true when you know the cons. There are some problems I will expose in this blog post and not related to rust only but related in fact about two other factors. A) “New” languages. Rust has +10 years, however still not mainstream, and I still consider it a new language. B) New Paradigm / Approach — everything you deviate from standard C/OOP you will face resistance. I saw it happens a lot with other languages like Scala and Clojure. These problems happen in rust but I want to make it absolutely clear they are not unique to rust. So Let’s get started, let’s start with the Good things.</p>
