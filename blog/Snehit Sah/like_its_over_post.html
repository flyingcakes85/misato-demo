    <i>We lost because our defence was strong</i>

<p>Next time, we take the front stage. What did I do as a midfielder? Their weak attack couldn't even get that ball past the center line for most of the time. Meanwhile, by putting our star players on defence ensured that <em>we</em> don't get past <em>their</em> superb defence. However, they managed to accidently put up a goal, and the balance tilted in their favor.</p>
<p>The strategy must change. Forget that coach. Never has he played a game in Downtown. I bet they don't even kick the football properly at his countryside.</p>
<p>He says, <em>&quot;Save your castle&quot;</em>, but whom should we save it from?. We might be the first team to ever lose a match on this ground because the team's defence was strong.</p>
